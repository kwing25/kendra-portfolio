## About This Portfolio

I built this portfolio as a clean, focused space to present my work as a developer.  
Rather than listing everything I’ve ever touched, the goal is to highlight:

- Projects that demonstrate practical problem solving
- Thoughtful UI and user experience decisions
- Clear, maintainable code
- My interests in accessibility, performance, and developer experience

This site is intentionally simple, fast, and content-driven.
